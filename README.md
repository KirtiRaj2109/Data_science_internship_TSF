# Data_science_internship_TSF

In this task it is required to predict the percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours studied using the Linear Regression supervised machine learning algorithm.

I have completed my task1 of data science and business analytics internship at the sparks foundation.

Thank you the sparks foundation for giving me this opportunity.
